# A Morphology-Driven Approach to NLP for a Low-Resource Language

This repository contains the code for the paper "A Morphology-Driven Approach to NLP for a Low-Resource, Highly Complex Language."

## Overview

This project demonstrates an approach to optimize standard NLP algorithms for morphologically rich, low-resource languages like Georgian. By leveraging the language's inherent morphological structure to dynamically generate word forms, our method reduces computational complexity and the need for massive datasets, improving performance where models like mBERT and FastText may struggle.

### Key Optimizations

* Minimum Editing Distance
* Text Classification
* Language Modeling
* Word-Level Semantic Similarity
